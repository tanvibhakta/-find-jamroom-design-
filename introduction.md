## Abstract
It is tough for the multiple people already co-ordinating with each other to also co-ordinate on various different music rooms. If you have all the information in one place, it is easy to do something with it.


## Long term goal
To create an application that manages the reservation of rooms where all types of music can be professionally practised and recorded.


## Optimistic Outcome
### MVP
+ Users can see information relevant to the music rooms they are considering using
+ Users can book these rooms through the application
+ Users can contact music room managers
### Middle Stage
+ Users can advertise their music rooms
+ Users can leave feedback about music rooms
### Late Stage
+ Users can [find technicians and other relevant people] [obtain services] to manage music rooms
+ Users will be able to book rooms for other special activities (ex: Dance Studios, Sports Arenas)


## Actors
+ Band members
+ Music room managers
+ Technicians and other related service professionals


## Tentative Problems faced during implementation of project:
1. Data Discovery [What are the music rooms in the city open to the public?]
2. Data Collection [What are the features do these music rooms offer?]
3. Getting the manager to check the app after the user has put in a book request
  - Notification App/Email/SMS
  - Insta booking feature [like AirBnB]
4. Preventing business from circumventing the middleman
  - Provide invaluable services [like AirBnB]
5. Quality Control issues of the room
  - Call and confirm [like NoBroker]
  - Ratings, feedback
6. Breakage etc that occurs in the room
  - You get charged automatically and won't be allowed to book again until you clear it [Uber model]
  - [AirBnB model?]


## Technical Solution
1. Web (PWA)
2. iOS
3. Android

This is to reach maximum market penetration. People who make music come from all backgrounds, and we therefore need services that cater to both categories

Due to time constraints, the rest of the module will focus only on the creation of the android app.


## Inspiration
1. AirBnB
  - Their explanation of the features each room in their catalogue has
  - Managers are human too, encouraging the community aspect of it
2. Zomato
  - Their restaurant discovery system with all the filters
3. Playo
  - It is a major player in this space except it deals more with sports and the surrounding communities than music.
